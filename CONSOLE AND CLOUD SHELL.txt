CONSOLE AND CLOUD SHELL

make sure you are signed in to the google cloud platform console
USING THE CLOUD SHELL AVAILABLE ON THE GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE

why running commands,all command should be in small letters and 

//To create a bucket, using the command line instructions
 to create the bucket,we run the command

 
gsutil mb gs://abdullahiusman46


 gsutil is the command for working on cloud storage and the <BUCKET NAME> should be replaced with a desired name which must be globally unique.

 uploading a file to bucket 1

 we can click on the three dot icon in the shell toolbar which displays a drop down,which also contains a heading for UPLOAD FILE.
 a new interface is being prompted for us to upload any desired file from our onpremise machine into the bucket.the name of the uploaded file should be made simple


 in the cloud shell,to confirm the file has been uploaded,we run 

ls

 this command list the available file in the bucket.


 to copy a file into another bucket,if we have two buckets created,then we can run the command

gsutil cp ['img.txt'] gs://abdullahiusman46

# cp stands for copy

 to select a region or zone,first we need to identify all available regions. To do so,we run the command

gcloud compute regions list

# create an environment variable with your region

INFRACLASS_REGION=[US-central1]

# verify region with echo

echo $INFRACLASS_REGION

# to create a sub directory 

mkdir infraclass

# create a file in the infraclass called class

touch infraclass/config

# append the calue of environment variable to the config class

echo INFRACLASS_REGION=$INFRACLASS_REGION >> ~/infraclass/config

# create a second environment variable for project id 

INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=gs://abdullahiusman46

# append value of project id

echo INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=$INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID >> ~/infraclass/config

# set the environment variable 

source infraclass/config

# verify project variable was set

echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID

# close and reopen the cloud shell

 issue the echo command again,there should be no output because environment variable no longer exists

echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID

# edit shell profile using the nano command

nano .profile

# add the following line

source infraclass/config

# Press Ctrl+O, ENTER to save the file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit nano.

 close and re open the cloud shell to cycle the VM

 use echo command to verify the variable is still set

echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID

# the expected value should now be seen.
